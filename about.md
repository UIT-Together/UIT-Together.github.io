# Join

I am currently recruiting PhD students with interests in computational modeling and numerical methods for fluid dynamics and combustion. Competitive candidates will possess strong computer programming skills and experience in command-line/UNIX systems and parallel computing. You can see more about my [primary research areas](/projects/), but I'm also open to other related areas.

Please refer to [available information](http://mime.oregonstate.edu/school-mime-graduate-school-admissions-faq) about applying to the [School of MIME]'s graduate program. Note that the yearly deadline to be fully considered is **January 15**.

I am also happy to talk to postdoctoral candidates, and undergraduate students interested in research are always welcome.

# Design and Implementation

Although I created a [personal website](http://kyleniemeyer.com) years ago using [Jekyll] (originally as a grad student), I recently came across the research group websites of [Holly Bik] and [D. Allan Drummond] and fell in love with their simple but effective designs. (These were both in turn inspired by [Trevor Bedford]'s site.) I greatly appreciate that these groups all shared their site source; in particular, my group site is directly based on the [Drummond Lab template].

This site's source code is freely available on [GitHub] under the MIT license, and deployed using [GitHub Pages].
