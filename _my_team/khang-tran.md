Khang graduated from the University of Portland, where he took part in a research project to investigate a new type of natural gas centrifugal compressor to achieve near isothermal compression. Within that research team, he helped design and build a data acquisition system, as well as multiple pressure vessel prototypes for testing purposes. Currently, Khang is continuing the research effort for a major U.S. energy companyâ€”a project the lab has been working on prior to his arrival. Outside of research, Khang enjoys hiking, camping, weightlifting, as well as adrenaline-rush activities such as skydiving and bungee-jumping.

Khang is co-advised by [Prof. Christopher Hagen](http://osucascades.edu/energy-systems-lab/dr-christopher-hagen) in the [Energy Systems Lab].
