# Water vapor paper posted online

Our latest paper: *The vertical structure of tropospheric water vapor: comparing radiative and ocean-driven climate changes*, by Rose and Rencurrel, is in press for **Journal of Climate**. See previous post for a description. The preprint is now available online from my [publication page](../../publications), or directly from [Journal of Climate](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0482.1).
