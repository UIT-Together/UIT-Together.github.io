# Snowball Earth synthesis submitted to Science Advances

Brian contributed to a new synthesis article on the geology and climate dynamics of Snowball Earth, just submitted to [Science Advances](http://advances.sciencemag.org).

The lead author is [Paul F. Hoffman](http://www.geosociety.org/awards/09speeches/sgt.htm), the geologist who has been the leading champion of the Neoproterozoic [Snowball Earth](http://www.snowballearth.org/index.html) hypothesis. Dr. Hoffman has long advocated for the importance of forward modeling studies of the physical and chemical environment of a Snowball Earth event, to bring context and constraints to the interpretation of the geological record. Along the way, he has cultivated relationships with some of the best climate dynamicists and modelers in the business. This review article summarizes recent progress on understanding the most profound episodes of global environmental change in Earth history.
