All members of the research group, along with visitors, are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Additionally, we collectively agree to enforce this code. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

## The Quick Version

This research group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of group members or other colleagues in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any professional setting, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Research group members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the group at the discretion of Kyle Niemeyer.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of the research environment, talks, or other events, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, or creation of an otherwise sexualized environment.

Group members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a member engages in harassing behavior, other group members and Kyle Niemeyer may take any action they deem appropriate to stop this behavior, including warning the offender or expulsion from the group and sanctioning through official Oregon State University channels.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Kyle Niemeyer immediately. Kyle is available to help group members contact security or local law enforcement, navigate official University reporting channels, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe in the research environment.

If Kyle is the cause of the concern or you would prefer he not be involved, official concerns can be addressed by contacting [Nicole Thompson](mailto:Nicole.Thompson@oregonstate.edu) or [Harriet Nembhard](mailto:harriet.nembhard@oregonstate.edu) in the School of MIME, or the [Oregon State University Equal Opportunity and Access office](http://eoa.oregonstate.edu).

We expect research group members to follow these rules in all professional settings including the office, conferences, workshop venues, and group-related social events. We additionally expect members to treat each other professionally with respect to their work and workspaces, with constructive criticism, without dismissive behavior, and without disruption of shared working spaces.
