# Teaching

Here's a list of all the courses I've taught since starting at UAlbany in Fall 2013.
Links to legacy webpages for previous versions of each course are provided below.

## The Atmosphere (AATM 100)

An introduction to the essential processes acting in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere for non-majors.
AATM 100 is an approved Natural Science course in the [UAlbany General Education Program](https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/general_education.html).

Spring 2021: fully online/asynchronous course on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.albany.edu/)

## Atmospheric Dynamics (AATM 500)

Core graduate course on the fundamentals of geophysical fluid dynamics and large-scale atmospheric motions.

[Fall 2015](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM500_Fall2015),
[Fall 2016](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM500_Fall2016),
[Fall 2017](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM500_Fall2017),
[Fall 2018](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM500_Fall2018),
[Fall 2019](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM500_Fall2019),
Fall 2020 (course has moved to the Blackboard platform, taught in hybrid synchronous simulcast mode)

## Climate Laboratory (AENV 415 / AATM 415)

A hands-on course in climate modeling. Learn about climate science by building and using models.
Open to students in the ATM and ENV programs (typically in junior or senior year).
The latest version of this course uses my interactive textbook
[The Climate Laboratory](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/)

[Spring 2014](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ENV480_Spring2014/),
[Spring 2016](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ENV415_Spring2016/),
[Spring 2018](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ENV415_Spring2018/),
[Spring 2020](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ENV415_Spring2020/)

*Note that the Spring 2020 version moved to Blackboard midway through the semester
due to the COVID-19 shutdown.*

## Climate Modeling (AATM 623)

Advanced graduate course in the theory and practice of modeling the climate system and climate processes.
My interactive textbook [The Climate Laboratory](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/)
was developed through several iterations of teaching this course
and the undergraduate Climate Laboratory course.

[Spring 2015](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2015)
[Spring 2017](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2017),
[Spring 2019](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2019)

## Dynamic Meteorology I (AATM 316)

Core undergraduate course on the dynamics of large-scale atmospheric motions.

[Fall 2014](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM316_Fall2014/)

## Oceans and Climate Seminar (AATM 619)

A graduate seminar on the fundamental of ocean circulation and its effects on the climate system.

[Fall 2013](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM619_Fall2013/)
