# New website!

Hello world! Welcome to the latest refresh of my website!

This Sphinx-based redesign was inspired by [this blog post by Chris Holdgraf](https://predictablynoisy.com/posts/2020/sphinx-blogging/).
Thanks Chris for all you do to keep the Python-based open-source community moving forward!

I also borrowed liberally from [Ryan Abernathey's group website](https://ocean-transport.github.io).

The Sphinx source for this new website [is on github here](https://github.com/brian-rose/brian-rose-site).
