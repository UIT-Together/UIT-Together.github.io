Brian gave a science talk at a bar!

"Climate Sensitivity in an Uncertain World" occurred on the evening of October 2, 2018 at Slidin' Dirty in Schenectady NY. This was a special [Science on Tap](https://www.capsciny.org/project/science-on-tap/) event coinciding with the [MiSci Science Festival](https://www.misci.org/events/science-festival).

The talk was about the concept of climate sensitivity, and some of the difficulties around using historical observations to infer future sensitivity. The slides are now available from the [Shareables page]({{ site.baseurl }}/code).
