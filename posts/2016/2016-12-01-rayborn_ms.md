# Lance Rayborn completes his MS thesis

**Lance Rayborn** has successfully completed and defended his thesis for the MS (Master of Science) degree, and is the first graduate from our group!

Lance's thesis is entitled *Understanding the Dependence of Radiative Feedbacks and Clouds on the Spatial Structure of Ocean Heat Uptake*. It is a follow-up study to Rose et al. (2014, GRL). Lance used a variety of analysis techniques including *radiative kernels* to carefully compare the response of several different climate models to specific imposed patterns of ocean heat uptake. In particular, the study aims to draw specific causal links between spatial patterns of heat uptake under transient global warming and cloud processes that shape the overall global climate sensitivity.

A publication based on these results is in preparation.
