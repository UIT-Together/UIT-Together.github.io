# Cameron Rencurrel and Lance Rayborn awarded summer research fellowships

Two of our graduate students have been awarded funded fellowships to attend computational research workshops in Summer 2016.

**Cameron Rencurrel** will travel to NCAR in Boulder Colorado to attend the [Dynamical Core Model Intercomparion Project (DCMIP) Summer School on Future-Generation Non-Hydrostatic Weather and Climate Models](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/events/summer-school/dcmip/2016/dcmip-2016). This will include two weeks of lectures and workshops on the theory, design and development of next-generation numerical models for atmospheric simulation. Sponsors include NCAR, NOAA, NASA, NSF, DOE, and the WMO.

**Lance Rayborn** will travel to the University of Virginia in Charlottesville to attend the [Advanced Computing for Earth Sciences (ACES) program](http://www.arcs.virginia.edu/aces). This is a three-week intensive summer school on advanced high-performance computing, sponsored by NASA.

Both students have been selected to receive full funding from the respective organizations to support their travel, lodging and participation costs. Congratulations Cameron and Lance on these competitive awards!
