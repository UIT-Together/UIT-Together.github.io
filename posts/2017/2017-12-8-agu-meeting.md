# Rose group @ AGU!

Our climate dynamics group will be traveling in New Orleans next week to share some recent research and catch up with all our colleagues at the [AGU Fall Meeting 2017](http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2017/)!

Here are abstract numbers and links for all our contributions:

- [A53E-2293: Stratospheric and Tropospheric Contributions to the Flux of Moist Static Energy Across 70ÂºN](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/281765) (**Christopher Cardinale** and Brian E. J. Rose)
- [C12B-07: Climate in the absence of ocean heat transport](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/284407) (**Brian E. J. Rose**)
