# Brian Rose receives NSF Career grant

I am very pleased to announce that I have received a 5-year grant from the National Science Foundation under their [Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER)](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503214).

The grant is entitled *CAREER: Understanding the role of oceans in the planetary energy budget*. It will provide critical support for our group's work studying the connections ocean heat uptake and transport and atmospheric processes (dynamical, radiative, hydrological) controlling the top-of-atmosphere radiation balance.

The grant also provides support for continued development of the [`climlab` software package](https://github.com/brian-rose/climlab.git) for process-oriented climate modeling, and an accompanying suite of educational modules.

Here is a [UAlbany press release](http://www.albany.edu/news/60872.php) about the award. We are looking forward to five very productive and stimulating years of work!
