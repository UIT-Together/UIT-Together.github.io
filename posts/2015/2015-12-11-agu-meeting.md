# Our group goes to AGU!

Our climate dynamics group will shortly be traveling to San Francisco to share some recent research and catch up with all our colleagues at the [AGU Fall Meeting 2015](http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2015/)!

Here are abstract numbers and links for all our contributions:

- [A44A-05: Robust Effects of Ocean Heat Uptake on Radiative Feedback and Subtropical Cloud Cover: A Study Using Radiative Kernels](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm15/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/65053) (**Lance Rayborn** and Brian Rose)

- [PP41A-2223: Atmospheric Compensation of Variations in Tropical Ocean Heat Transport: Understanding Mechanisms and Implications on Tectonic Timescales](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm15/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/63742) (**Michael Cameron Rencurrel** and Brian Rose)

- [PP41A-2212: Climate in the Absence of Ocean Heat Transport](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm15/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/68383) (**Brian Rose**)

- [ED51A-0806: CLIMLAB: a Python-based software toolkit for interactive, process-oriented climate modeling](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm15/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/68419) (**Brian Rose**)

Brian will also be co-chairing a session with Hansi Singh (University of Washington) [A51V: Polar Climate and Predictability I](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm15/meetingapp.cgi/Session/10924)
