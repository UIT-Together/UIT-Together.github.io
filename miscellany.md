## Public presentation: "Climate Sensitivity in an Uncertain World" (Science on Tap, October 2018)

I gave this presentation at Slidin' Dirty in Schenectady NY as a special [Science on Tap](https://www.capsciny.org/project/science-on-tap/) event coinciding with the [MiSci Science Festival](https://www.misci.org/events/science-festival). My talk was about the concept of climate sensitivity, and some of the difficulties around using historical observations to infer future sensitivity.

The slides are available here [in pdf format (.pdf)](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/resources/SensitivityUncertain.pdf) or [in Apple Keynote format (.key)](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/resources/SensitivityUncertain.key).


## AMS Tools of the Trade presentation: Reproducible workflows with Jupyter notebooks

In January 2018 I gave an invited presentation at the Tools of the Trade session of the AMS Student Conference, where I discussed the use of the Jupyter notebook and other Python-based tools for open and reproducible workflows in atmospheric sciences. All the material is available online:

- Video of the presentation is [available from AMS](https://ams.confex.com/ams/98Annual/videogateway.cgi/id/42749?recordingid=42749)
- The example notebooks are [on github](https://github.com/brian-rose/ToolsOfTheTrade2018_JupyterNotebooks)
- My slides are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lh9mic4p1vgqb1r/Rose_Jupyter.pptx?dl=0)


## Matlab code for an equilibrium Energy Balance Model
The 1D diffusion equation model described in {cite}`Rose:2014a`, with spatially varying radiative feedback and diffusion of moist static energy. Included data files give fits to the CAM4 aquaplanet GCM simulations. Code is included to reproduce Fig. 4 from {cite}`Rose:2014a`.
The code uses [bvp4c.m](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/bvp4c.html) to solve the energy balance boundary value problem.

## History of climate science
Here are slides for a presentation on the history of climate science that I first gave at MIT in January 2008:
[Looking Back on the Future of Climate Change](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/resources/LookingBackOnClimate.pdf)

A better and deeper discussion of the history of the CO2-climate connection was given by [Ray Pierrehumbert in his 2012 Tyndall Lecture at AGU](https://youtu.be/RICBu_P8JWI)

And here is an interesting essay on [Gilbert Plass CO2 calculations and the surface budget fallacy](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/01/plass-and-the-surface-budget-fallacy/) (also by Ray Pierrehumbert).
