      bio: >
        Fearless leader of the Rose research group!
        I'm passionate about science, education, math, the Earth,
        open-source software, bicycles, building communities,
        music (stringed instruments especially),
        food, drink, and family. When I'm not working, I'm basically a hobbit.

        My research interests include the variability and vertical structure
        of the atmospheric energy transport and its role in polar warming on
        synoptic and climate timescales, and tropospheric-stratospheric coupling.
        Outside of work, I enjoy music, disc golf, second breakfast,
        and identifying trees while hiking.

        I am enthusiastic about climate science in general.
        My research interests include multiple equilibria in the coupled climate
        system and causes of glacial-interglacial cycles.
        Using a hierarchy of climate models and the theories of nonlinear
        dynamical systems, my goal is to understand how every component of the
        climate system has worked together to produce the large climatic
        transitions in the Earth’s history.
        When I’m not working, I enjoy reading, walking, violin and clouds.

        I enjoy understanding the processes related to large-scale climate dynamics and climate change. My research interests include (1) uncertainty in climate sensitivity and its relation to the ocean (2) interactions between ocean, clouds, and radiation (3) time-evolving ocean circulation under climate change.

        I am generally interested in using physics and computational modeling to 
        understand Earth's climate. My nonacademic interests include guitar and reading.
