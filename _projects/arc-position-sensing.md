summary: >
  Vacuum arc remelting (VAR) furnaces have been used for decades to produce high-quality
  metal ingots for demanding applications like in the aerospace and biomedical
  fields, but the extreme conditions inside a furnace make diagnostics and control
  of the process challenging. This project analyzed an approach for sensing the
  position of the electrical arc inside a VAR furnace using finite element simulations.
