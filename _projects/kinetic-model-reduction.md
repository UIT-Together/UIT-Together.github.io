summary: >
  Simulations of combustion and chemically reacting flows use chemical kinetic
  models to describe how hydrocarbon fuels break down and react. But, these models
  can be extremely large and complex, particularly for fuel components relevant
  to practical transportation fuels. This project develops tools for reducing the
  size and complexity of these models.
