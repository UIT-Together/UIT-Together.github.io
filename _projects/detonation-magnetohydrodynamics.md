summary: >
  This project is investigating a concept for efficient electrical power generation
  using a pulse detonation engine (PDE) coupled with direct power extraction via a
  magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator. The system is particularly well-suited for
  pure oxygen combustion (oxy-combustion) since it doesn't have any moving interior
  parts, so it could offer a viable approach to producing power efficiently and
  capturing the carbon from the exhaust.
