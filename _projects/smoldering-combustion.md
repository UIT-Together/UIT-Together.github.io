summary: >
  Smoldering combustion plays an important role in wildfires, since it can contribute
  significantly to carbon emissions and also transition back to the flaming mode
  of combustion. However, the physical and chemical processes that control the
  ignition, propagation, and emissions of smoldering in woody fuels are not well
  understood, and this project is working to fix that.
